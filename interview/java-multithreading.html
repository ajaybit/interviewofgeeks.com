                                <h5 class="question">1. What is multithreading?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads
                                    simultaneously. Multithreading is used to obtain the multitasking. It consumes less
                                    memory and gives the fast and efficient performance. Its main advantages are:</p>
                                <ul class="read-para">
                                    <li>Threads share the same address space.</li>
                                    <li>The thread is lightweight.</li>
                                    <li>The cost of communication between the processes is low.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5 class="question">2. What is the thread?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">A thread is a lightweight subprocess. It is a separate path of
                                    execution because each thread runs in a different stack frame. A process may contain
                                    multiple threads. Threads share the process resources, but still, they execute
                                    independently.</p>

                                <h5 class="question">3. Differentiate between process and thread?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">There are the following differences between the process and thread.
                                </p>
                                <ul class="read-para">
                                    <li>A Program in the execution is called the process whereas; A thread is a subset
                                        of the process</li>
                                    <li>Processes are independent whereas threads are the subset of process.</li>
                                    <li>Process have different address space in memory, while threads contain a shared
                                        address space.</li>
                                    <li>Context switching is faster between the threads as compared to processes.</li>
                                    <li>Inter-process communication is slower and expensive than inter-thread
                                        communication.</li>
                                    <li>Any change in Parent process doesn't affect the child process whereas changes in
                                        parent thread can affect the child thread.</li>
                                </ul> <br>

                                    <li>The process of communication between synchronized threads is termed as
                                        inter-thread communication.</li>
                                    <li>Inter-thread communication is used to avoid thread polling in Java.</li>
                                    <li>The thread is paused running in its critical section, and another thread is
                                        allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed.</li>
                                    <li>It can be obtained by wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5 class="question">5. What is the purpose of wait() method in Java?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">The wait() method is provided by the Object class in Java. This
                                    method is used for inter-thread communication in Java. The java.lang.Object.wait()
                                    is used to pause the current thread, and wait until another thread does not call the
                                    notify() or notifyAll() method. Its syntax is given below. <br><br>

                                    public final void wait()</p>
                                <hr>

                                <h5 class="question">6. Why must wait() method be called from the synchronized block?
                                </h5>

                                <p class="read-para">We must call the wait method otherwise it will throw
                                    <span>java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException </span> exception. Moreover, we need
                                    wait() method for inter-thread communication with notify() and notifyAll().
                                    Therefore It must be present in the synchronized block for the proper and correct
                                    communication.

                                <p class="read-para">Multithreading programming has the following advantages:</p>

                                <ul class="read-para">
                                    <li>Multithreading allows an application/program to be always reactive for input,
                                        even already running with some background tasks</li>
                                    <li>Multithreading allows the faster execution of tasks, as threads execute
                                        independently.</li>
                                    <li>Multithreading provides better utilization of cache memory as threads share the
                                        common memory resources.</li>
                                    <li>Multithreading reduces the number of the required server as one server can
                                        execute multiple threads at a time.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5 class="question">8. What are the states in the lifecycle of a Thread?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">A thread can have one of the following states during its lifetime:
                                </p>

                                        created using a new operator, but the thread is not alive. Thread doesn't start
                                        until we call the start() method.</li>
                                    <li class="read-para"><span>Runnable:</span> In this state, the thread is ready to

                                    slicing?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">Under preemptive scheduling, the highest priority task executes
                                    until it enters the waiting or dead states or a higher priority task comes into
                                    existence. Under time slicing, a task executes for a predefined slice of time and
                                    then reenters the pool of ready tasks. The scheduler then determines which task
                                    should execute next, based on priority and other factors.</p>
