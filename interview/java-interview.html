                                <p class="read-para">There are the following features in Java Programming Language.
                                <ul class="read-para">
                                    <li>
                                        <spna style="font-weight: bolder;">Simple:</spna> Java is easy to learn. The
                                        syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes
                                        easier to write the program in it.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Object-Oriented:</span> Java follows the
                                        object-oriented paradigm which allows us to
                                        maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that
                                        incorporates both data and behavior.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Portable:</span> Java supports
                                        read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the
                                        Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode
                                        (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Platform Independent:</span> Java is a
                                        platform independent programming language. It is
                                        different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform
                                        to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java
                                        doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Secured:</span> Java is secured because it
                                        doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also
                                        provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more
                                        secured.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Robust:</span> Java is a strong programming
                                        language as it uses strong memory
                                        management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling,
                                        etc. make it more robust.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Architecture Neutral: </span>Java is
                                        architectural neutral as it is not dependent on
                                        the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the
                                        architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">High Performance:</span> Java is faster than
                                        other traditional interpreted programming
                                        languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little
                                        bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Multithreaded:</span> We can write Java
                                        programs that deal with many tasks at once by
                                        defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it
                                        doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads
                                        are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.</li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Distributed:</span> Java is distributed
                                        because it facilitates users to create
                                        distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed
                                        applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the
                                        methods from any machine on the internet.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Dynamic:</span> Java is a dynamic language.
                                        It supports dynamic loading of classes. It
                                        means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native
                                        languages, i.e., C and C++.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5 class="question">4. What do you understand by Java virtual machine?</h5>
                                <p class="read-para">Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer
                                    to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method
                                    present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the
                                    computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine
                                    independent and close to the native code.

                                    JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides
                                    the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a
                                    specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its
                                    implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation
                                    is known as JRE.
                                    <br><br>
                                    JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform
                                    dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class.
                                    There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.

                                    JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java
                                    Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java
                                    applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the

                                    The methods or variables defined as static are shared among all the objects of the
                                    class. The static is the part of the class and not of the object. The static
                                    variables are stored in the class area, and we do not need to create the object to
                                    access such variables. Therefore, static is used in the case, where we need to
                                    define variables or methods which are common to all the objects of the class.

                                        task on object creation. A default constructor is invoked implicitly by the
                                        compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.</li>

                                        initialize the instance variables with the given values. In other words, we can
                                        say that the constructors which can accept the arguments are called
                                        parameterized constructors.

                                    area at the time of class loading. Using a static variable makes your program more
                                    memory efficient (it saves memory). Static variable belongs to the class rather than
                                    the object.

                                    As we know that the static context (method, block, or variable) belongs to the
                                    class, not the object. Since Constructors are invoked only when the object is
                                    created, there is no sense to make the constructors static. However, if you try to
                                    do so, the compiler will show the compiler error.

                                <p class="read-para">In Java, if we make the abstract methods static, It will become the
                                    part of the class, and we can directly call it which is unnecessary. Calling an
                                    undefined method is completely useless therefore it is not allowed.

                                <p class="read-para">Yes, we can declare static variables and methods in an abstract
                                    method. As we know that there is no requirement to make the object to access the
                                    static context, therefore, we can access the static context declared inside the
                                    abstract class by using the name of the abstract class. Consider the following
                                    example.</p>
