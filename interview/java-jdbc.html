                                <p class="read-para">JDBC is a Java API that is used to connect and execute the query to
                                    the database. JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect to the database. JDBC API can be
                                    used to access tabular data stored into any relational database.</p>

                                </h5>
                                <p class="read-para">JDBC Driver is a software component that enables Java application
                                    to interact with the database. There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:</p>
                                <ul class="read-para">
                                    <li class="read-para"><span>JDBC-ODBC bridge driver:</span>The JDBC-ODBC bridge
                                        driver uses the ODBC driver to connect to the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge
                                        driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls. This is now
                                        discouraged because of the thin driver. It is easy to use and can be easily
                                        connected to any database.</li>
                                    <li class="read-para"><span>Native-API driver (partially java driver): </span>The
                                        Native API driver uses the client-side libraries of the database. The driver
                                        converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. It is not
                                        written entirely in Java. Its performance is better than JDBC-ODBC bridge
                                        driver. However, the native driver must be installed on each client machine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="read-para"><span>Network Protocol driver (fully java driver): </span>The
                                        Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC
                                        calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. It is
                                        entirely written in Java. There is no requirement of the client-side library
                                        because of the application server that can perform many tasks like auditing,
                                        load balancing, logging, etc.</li>
                                    <li class="read-para"><span>Thin driver (fully java driver): </span>The thin driver
                                        converts JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database protocol. That is
                                        why it is known as the thin driver. It is entirely written in Java language. Its
                                        performance is better than all other drivers however these drivers depend upon
                                        the database.</li>

                                </h5>
                                <p class="read-para">To maintain the integrity of a database, we need to ensure the ACID
                                    properties. ACID properties mean Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and durability.
                                    In JDBC, Connection interface provides methods like setAutoCommit(), commit(), and
                                    rollback() which can be used to manage transaction. Let's see an example of
                                    transaction management in JDBC.
